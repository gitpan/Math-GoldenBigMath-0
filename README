Math-GoldenBigMath version 0.802
===============================

Math::GoldenBigMath - Verified Big Real Number Calcualtion With Operators + - * / %

It uses pure Perl (no compilation needed), so you can run it from a
USB stick.

This module implements the algorithms I (and all other german
childrens) learned in my school, in german called "Schriftliches
Rechnen". That means exact calculation with pencil and paper, before
computers or electronical calculators come up.

All of these alogrithms are exact, simple, well known and mathematical
completely proven. But they are not very fast, even for computers.

So GoldenBigMath can be used for calculation, if high speed is not
necessary or you have time to wait for the results.

It was designed to be used as a golden device to check all the other
existing libraries handling big numbers, which are fast and
complicated and so can contain errors.
